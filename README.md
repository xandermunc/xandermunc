Hi, I’m @xandermunc.
I'm a graphic designer and musician, recently graduated from MECA&D with a BFA in graphic design. 
I’m interested in the power of design, interactive code and spaces, conveying complex ideas with clarity, 2D & 3D animation, counterpoint, and jazz theory. 
I’m currently learning how to create desktop applications with Electron and studying the physics of waves.
